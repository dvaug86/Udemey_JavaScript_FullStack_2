    <h1>Best action franchises according to David</h1>
    <h2>These are what I consider my favorite action franchises</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>1. John Wick</h3>
    <p>The attention to detail and creating it's own world are incredible.</p>
    <h3>2. Die hard</h3>
    <p>
      I am mainly considering the first 3 but just the humor in the seriousness
      and during the 90s they were peak action.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Extraction</h3>
    <p>While only 2 movies I really like how these were filmed.</p>
